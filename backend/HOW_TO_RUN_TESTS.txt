========================================
  STOP! DON'T RUN TESTS WITH NODE!
========================================

❌ WRONG WAY (This will NOT work):
   E:\...\backend\tests\unit> node groqService.test.js

✅ CORRECT WAY:
   E:\...\backend> npm test

========================================

Why "node groqService.test.js" doesn't work:
- Tests use Jest functions (describe, test, expect)
- These functions don't exist in plain Node.js
- You'll get "ReferenceError: describe is not defined"

========================================

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
========================================

1. Go to the BACKEND folder (not tests folder!):
   
   cd E:\College Work\Sem-5\DBMS\project\backend


2. Make sure you have .env.test file:
   
   copy .env .env.test


3. Install dependencies (if you haven't):
   
   npm install


4. Run tests with npm:
   
   npm test

   OR for just unit tests:
   
   npm run test:unit


========================================

CURRENT LOCATION CHECK:
========================================

If you're in: backend\tests\unit\
You need to: cd ..\..

If you're in: backend\tests\
You need to: cd ..

If you're in: backend\
You're good! Run: npm test

========================================

QUICK COMMANDS (Copy & Paste):
========================================

# From any tests folder, go back to backend:
cd E:\College Work\Sem-5\DBMS\project\backend

# Copy environment file:
copy .env .env.test

# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run tests:
npm test
